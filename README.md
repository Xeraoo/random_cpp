# Miscellaneous C++ Snippets

This repository contains a collection of small C++ programs and functions, showcasing a variety of algorithms, calculations, and utilities. These snippets serve as isolated examples of problem-solving and programming concepts, ranging from basic mathematical operations to more complex implementations like sorting algorithms and matrix transposition. Although not part of larger projects, these examples are useful for learning, experimentation, and quick references.

### Highlights
- **Mathematical algorithms**: Fibonacci sequences, Delta calculations, and NWD (Greatest Common Divisor).
- **Utilities**: Temperature calculators, table operations, and bubble sort.
- **Miscellaneous**: Word generation, matrix operations, and simple user interaction programs.

Feel free to explore the code for educational purposes or to integrate specific functions into larger projects.
